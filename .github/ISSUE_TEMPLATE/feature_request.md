**Problem:**
A Post can be deleted or edited on the apost.html using post id. <br>
This is not possible on the home.html because the bottons does not have the post ID. <br>
User should be able to Like & comment on the post on home.html rather than view the post and then react to post. <br>

**Solution:**

Edit,Delete,Like,comment <br>
These events can be trigered using post ID & every single btn should be unique.
